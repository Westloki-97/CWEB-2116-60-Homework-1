# Homework01 (C# Console App)

This repo contains a complete starter for **CWEB 2116-60 Application Design I – Homework 01**.

It implements:
- Output statements
- Comments (single-line, multi-line, XML docs)
- Variables & data types
- Constants (π) and a circle area example
- Typecasting and if-else (voter eligibility)
- `switch` statement calculator

## How to run (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# 1) Unzip this folder somewhere easy, e.g. Desktop
# 2) Open PowerShell and cd into the solution folder:
cd "Homework01_CSharp/Homework01_CSharp"

# 3) List the folder to make sure files are present
ls

# 4) Change into the project folder
cd .\Homework01

# 5) Build then run
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

### Common gotcha
If you see `MSBUILD : error MSB1003: Specify a project or solution file. The current working directory does not contain a project or solution file.` then you are **not inside the project folder**. Make sure your prompt ends with `...\Homework01` before running `dotnet build`.
